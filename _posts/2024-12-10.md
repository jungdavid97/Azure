<h2>Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)</h2>

__Describe cloud computing__

- Define cloud computing

  - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change

- Describe the shared responsibility model

  - The workload responsibilities vary depending on whether the workload is hosted on Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or in an on-premises datacenter (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility)

    - Software as a service
   
      - Identity and directory infrastructure
     
    - Platform as a service
   
      - Identity and directory infrastructure
     
      - Applications
     
      - Network controls

- Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid

  - Public cloud model
    
    - Public clouds are the most common type of cloud computing deployment. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud
      - Advantages of public clouds

        - __Lower costs__ no need to purchase hardware or software, and you pay only for the service you use
       
        - __No maintenance__ your service provider provides the maintenance
       
        - __Near-unlimited scalability__ on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs
       
        - __High reliability__ a vast network of servers ensure against failure
    
  - Private cloud model
    
    - A private cloud consists of cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organization. (Financial institutions)
   
      - Advantages of a private cloud
     
        - __More flexibility__ your organization can customize its cloud environment to meed specific business needs
       
        - __More control__ resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and privacy are possible
       
        - __More scalability__ private clouds often offer more scalability compared to on-premises infrascructure
    
  - Hybrid cloud model
    
    - A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments.
   
      - Advantages of a hybrid cloud
     
        - __Control__ your organization can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets or workloads that require low latency
       
        - __Flexibility__ you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them
       
        - __Cost-effectiveness__ with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed
       
        - __Ease__ transitioning to the cloud doesn't have to be overwhelming because you can migrate gradually, phasing in workloads over time
